Background

Nodely is an interactive, time-sensitive, math and logic game.  The game spawns source-nodes and sink-nodes.  The aim of the game is to sum values using source-nodes and thereby creating intermediate-nodes that sum up to the value of a sink-node. Once that is done, players can connect that node to the sink-node and have the game continue.

Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

 - Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and game logic,
 - HTML5 Canvas for rendering and grid for game,
 - Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.


Status
In progress, but major features have been implemented. Bug fixes and seamless gameplay are next on the agenda.
